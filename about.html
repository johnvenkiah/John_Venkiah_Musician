                Sweden-based jazz and soul musician John Venkiah was born in 1986 in North London. He started to play
                the keyboard at 5 years of age, and moved to Sweden in 1998.
                Playing mostly by ear, John listened to records his mother played for him, and learnt a lot by playing
                what he heard.

                As he grew into his teens, both singing and playing became a bigger part of his life.

                soul, Motown and jazz.
                He began studying music at high school, where he met fellow musicians and started his first bands.
