                Sweden-based jazz and soul musician John Venkiah was born in 1986 in North London. He started to play
                the keyboard at 5 years of age, and moved to Sweden in 1998.
                Playing mostly by ear, John listened to records his mother played for him, and learnt a lot by playing
                what he heard.

                As he grew into his teens, both singing and playing became a bigger part of his life.
                John began writing his own music at the age of 14, experimenting with different influences, including
                soul, Motown and jazz.
                He began studying music at high school, where he met fellow musicians and started his first bands.
